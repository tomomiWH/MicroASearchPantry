# Pantry Search Items Microservice

## Overview

The Pantry Search Items Microservice provides search functionality that allows users to request and receive filtered results from the pantry items. Users specify their search type and search term, which are saved in a user input file called `MicroAUserCommPipe.txt` (generated by the main program). 

The microservice reads the user's preferences from `MicroAUserCommPipe.txt`, performs the requested search operation, and writes the results back to `MicroAUserCommPipe.txt` temporarily, before finalizing the output in `SearchResult.txt`.
